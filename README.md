# Implementation of Neural LAM by Divan van der Bank - Creating SA-GNN

This model called **SA-GNN** is based on work done by *Oskarsson, Joel and Landelius, Tomas and Lindsten, Fredrik* and details the modification and validation of their **neural-lam model** on `ERA5 data` for the `region of South Africa`. The results of this model will be compared to **current leading AI weather prediction models** and numeric weather prediction models using a modified version of **WeatherBench** by *Rasp, Stephan*.
